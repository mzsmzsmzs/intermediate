**“This slide summarizes our backup and restore best practices for VNF VMs running on KubeVirt.
We’ve built a custom Backup & Restore CRD, which makes the entire BnR process declarative and Kubernetes-native — from policy definition to execution and recovery.

For scalability, we run up to eight parallel backup streams per site, isolate CPU and memory for backup pods, and use WAN optimization with local caching to support 100+ distributed sites efficiently.

For application-aware backups, pre- and post-snapshot hooks ensure database consistency, while Kubernetes Jobs handle orchestration with zero manual intervention — achieving about 99.5% backup success and a major reduction in data corruption.

Finally, our incremental backup strategy with Changed Block Tracking and CSI driver integration tracks only modified blocks, reducing network traffic by 80% and cutting restore times by 60%.

Overall, this approach provides scalable, consistent, and storage-efficient BnR across all VNF deployments.”**
