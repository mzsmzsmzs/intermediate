Final 1.0:


**“This slide summarizes our backup and restore best practices for VNF VMs running on KubeVirt.
as mentioned before We’ve built a custom Backup & Restore CRD, which makes the entire process declarative…. and Kubernetes-native — from policy definition to execution of backup and restore and recovery.

A) for scaling backups to 100+ sites, we have  planned allocation CRD which defines 1) resource limits
and 2) resource requests per backup operations, i.e CPU, memory etc
This ensures backup don’t overwhelm hypervisors


B) For scalability, we run up to eight parallel backup streams per site …
..and use WAN optimization and bandwidth throttling for n/w optimization

optional-}
C) impact minimation is embeddedi n the CRD: CPU is capped at 25 % for hypervisor nodes, their memory is ilolated from VMs

A) using declarative BackupPolicy we schedule backup with application consistency, e.g MySQl database with pre- and post-snapshot hooks ensure database consistency,
B)…while Kubernetes Jobs handle orchestration with zero manual intervention —
C).. achieving about 99.5% of  backup success and a major reduction in data corruption.

Finally, our incremental backup strategy with Changed Block Tracking and CSI driver integration tracks only modified blocks,  with estimation of reducing network traffic by 80% and cutting restore times by 60%.

Overall, this approach provides scalable, consistent, and storage-efficient Backup and restore  across all VNF deployments.”**
