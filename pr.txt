Creating a meaningful project for interns on Microservices Versioning in CI/CD should be practical, educational, and aligned with industry standards. Below is a structured approach to defining the project:

Objective

To implement versioning strategies for microservices in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure smooth deployments, backward compatibility, and efficient delivery.

Project Breakdown

1. Problem Statement

Microservices evolve independently, and managing versions is critical for maintaining compatibility across services. The interns will create a microservice-based application, implement versioning strategies (e.g., API versioning), and integrate it into a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

2. Deliverables
	1.	Microservices with Versioning:
	•	At least 2–3 microservices with API versioning implemented.
	•	Example use case: E-commerce system with Product, Order, and User services.
	2.	Versioning Strategies:
	•	URL versioning (e.g., /api/v1/products).
	•	Semantic versioning for Docker images (e.g., product-service:1.0.0).
	3.	CI/CD Pipeline:
	•	Automate the build, test, and deployment process using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
	•	Use Docker for containerization and store images in a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
	4.	Documentation:
	•	Guidelines on versioning strategies.
	•	CI/CD setup documentation.
	5.	Demo Environment:
	•	Deploy the services on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP) or local Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube).

3. Key Features to Implement
	1.	API Versioning:
	•	Implement two versions of an API for one service (e.g., v1 and v2 of the Product service).
	•	Demonstrate backward compatibility between versions.
	2.	Database Migration:
	•	Use tools like Flyway or Liquibase to handle schema changes between versions.
	3.	Semantic Versioning:
	•	Tag microservices and Docker images with semantic versions.
	•	Use branching strategies (e.g., main for production, develop for testing).
	4.	CI/CD Pipeline Steps:
	•	Build: Compile and package the application.
	•	Test: Run unit and integration tests.
	•	Tag and Push: Tag Docker images with the semantic version and push to the registry.
	•	Deploy: Deploy to a Kubernetes or Docker Swarm environment.

4. Tools and Technologies
	•	Programming Language: Python (FastAPI), Node.js, or Java (Spring Boot).
	•	Containerization: Docker.
	•	CI/CD Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI.
	•	Version Control: Git.
	•	Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL.
	•	Infrastructure: Kubernetes (Minikube, Kind, or a cloud-managed service like EKS or GKE).
	•	API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI.
	•	Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana (optional).

5. Example Workflow
	1.	Set Up Repositories:
	•	Separate Git repositories for each microservice.
	•	Add a README for API versioning guidelines.
	2.	Implement Microservices:
	•	Create APIs with /v1 and /v2 endpoints.
	•	Example: /v1/products returns a simple JSON, while /v2/products supports filtering and pagination.
	3.	Integrate CI/CD:
	•	Write a Jenkinsfile or GitHub Actions workflow:
	•	Build the application.
	•	Run tests.
	•	Create Docker images tagged with v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.
	•	Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.
	4.	Demonstrate Deployment:
	•	Deploy the services using Helm or Kubernetes manifests.
	•	Demonstrate rolling updates for a new version.

6. Expected Outcome
	•	A fully functional microservice-based application with versioning.
	•	An automated CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, tags, and deploys microservices.
	•	Documentation on how versioning was implemented and handled in the pipeline.

Bonus Tasks
	•	Add blue-green deployment or canary releases in the pipeline.
	•	Implement backward compatibility tests for API versions.
	•	Use feature flags to control new API versions.

Resources
	1.	API Versioning:
	•	Best Practices for API Versioning
	2.	CI/CD for Microservices:
	•	Docker and Kubernetes CI/CD Pipeline Tutorial
	3.	Semantic Versioning:
	•	Semantic Versioning Documentation
